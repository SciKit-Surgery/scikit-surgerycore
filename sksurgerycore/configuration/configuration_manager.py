"""
Class to load application configuration information from a json file.

Design principles:
  - All errors as Exceptions
  - | Fail early in constructor, so the rest of the program never
    | has an invalid instance of ConfigurationManager.
    | If its constructed, its valid.
  - Setter and Getter do a deepcopy, so only suitable for small config files.
  - | Pass ConfigurationManager to any consumer of the data,
    | its up to the consumer to know where to find the data.
